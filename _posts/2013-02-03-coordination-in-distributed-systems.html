	Facing a coordination problem is almost one hundred percent guaranteed if you are working on a distributed system. Despite that we might strive for architecture where every node is able to work independently from others, there are tasks that simply require some kind of coordinating activity.
</p>

<p>
	What do I mean by coordination? Well, let's start with the simple problem. Common challenge in distributed systems is getting the <b>naming</b> right. Many distributed algorithms should be able to distinguish one process from another in order to work correctly. The trick is to come up with the solution that works in a distributed way, gives a processes unambiguously identifiable names among the system, and could support dynamic addition and removal of the nodes in cluster.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Configuration management</b> is an another coordination problem that pops out frequently. Every sophisticated system has to deal with some configuration information. Property files may sound great but let's imaging you have hundreds of nodes in the cluster running particular deployment packages and now you have to change the configuration property on all of this servers. Configuration files turns out to be great if meta information is static but using them for dynamic configuration doesn't seems to be good idea.
</p>

<p>
	To explain next problem let's picture some real world situation. Imagine that you are working on a social network web-site and there are two types of distributed processes: front-end servers that handles http requests and image servers responsible for the efficient image storage. Whenever user uploads the photo, front-end server has to communicate with image storage to save the image, so front-end server has to be configured to know the addresses of the image servers. Now imagine that photo sharing feature becomes extremely popular and we need to increase number of image servers in order to handle all content uploads. In addition let's be realistic and accept the fact that some of the servers might fail and we need to track that information and avoid sending requests to the failed server. Sounds non-trivial. Tracking which nodes are online is another configuration problem called <b>group membership</b>.
</p>

<p>
	Synchronization problems in a distributed systems is considered as part of coordination as well. They should be familiar for everyone who deals with a concurrent applications. In case if you have a some shared recourse in a distributed system you may require some <b>locking</b> mechanism to avoid race condition. You might want to organize a queue to implement <b>publisher-subscriber</b> protocol, some data modification may need <b>distributed transaction</b> and in order to get it in ACID way so you might to implement <b>two phase commit</b>.
</p>

<p>
	Last but not least problem I would like to mention is called <b>leader election</b>. Some distributed algorithms require one unique "leader" process that acts as point of coordination and communicates with other processes. If process acting as leader crashes, new leader process should be elected.
</p>

<p>
	Coordination problems may sound easy but implementing it correctly and in fault tolerant way may lead you to nights of hardcore debugging of highly concurrent code. No fun, huh? Fortunately, <a href="http://zookeeper.apache.org">Apache ZooKeeper</a> comes to rescue by providing set of reliable primitives, building blocks that allow us to tackle coordination problems with ease.
